# Under OS

An experiment to build a thin web-like wrapper over iOS using rubymotion

The idea is to use incapsulation instead of monkey patching and build the
entire development platform correctly and from scratch.

The result should be a webbish like ifrastructure that uses ruby instead
of JavaScript and compiles into native code in the end.

That's gonna be legendary!
